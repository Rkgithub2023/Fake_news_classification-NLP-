    <h1>Fake News Classifier Using LSTM 📰</h1>
    <p>This project implements a fake news classifier using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The process involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🗞️ Gathering and preparing news articles data</li>
        <li>🔍 Preprocessing text through tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization</li>
        <li>📊 Building and training an LSTM model to detect fake news</li>
        <li>✅ Evaluating the model’s performance to ensure accuracy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The LSTM model effectively captures the sequential patterns and context within news articles to classify them as real or fake. This system aids in identifying and filtering out misleading information, thereby enhancing the credibility of news sources.</p>
